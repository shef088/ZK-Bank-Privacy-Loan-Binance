# ZK-Bank Privacy Loan (Binance)

## Description
**ZK-Bank Privacy Loan (Binance)** is a decentralized application designed to enable privacy-preserving credit verification and loan applications using **zkPass**. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, users can prove their creditworthiness without revealing sensitive financial details. 

The app integrates with the **Binance predefined schemas**, specifically the **Earn Balance** and **Balance in the Last 24 Hours**, to verify users' financial standing. These schemas are combined to generate a composite creditworthiness score, which is then used to approve or reject loan applications.

With **zkPass** and these **Binance schemas**, users can maintain their financial privacy while accessing decentralized loan services.

## 3. Frontend Setup

1. Prerequisites:
  - Ensure you are using Chromium or Chrome as the zkPass Schema Validator and Transgate extensions are required.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project:
 
 - Run the following command to install required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure constants.js:

  - Navigate to src/ and open constants.js. Ensure the following fields are populated:
javascript

```
Replace BASE_URL with the URL of your backend server.
Start the Frontend Server.

4. Add the frontend url to the cors allow list in the index.js.

5. Run the following command to start the frontend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
 
## 4. Backend Setup
1. Go back to the root of the  project
2. Navigate to the backend Directory
3. Setup a mongodb or mongo atlas database and note your mongo connection string or connection uri.
3. Create .env File:
 - Create a .env file and populate it with the following information:
```bash
PORT=your_port_number
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
MONGO_URI=your-mondo-db-connection-uri
```

4. Install Dependencies:

   - Run the following command to install the necessary backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
5. Add the frontend url to the cors allow list in the index.js

6. Start the Backend Server:
```bash
npm start
```

7. Update constants.js:
 
  - Copy the URL of the running backend server and replace BASE_URL in src/constants.js with the copied URL.

 
## 5. Smart Contract Setup

 
1. Install Foundry:

 - In the root folder, run the following command to install Foundry:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```
2. Cd into the secret folder
3. Create .env File for Smart Contract:

 - In the secret directory, create a .env file and add the following contents:

SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_SEPOLIA_API_KEY
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY   #metamask privatekey
```
- Replace YOUR_INFURA_SEPOLIA_API_KEY and YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY with your actual values.

4. Test the Smart Contract:
 ```bash
forge test -vvv --summary
```

5. Deploy the Smart Contract:
 ```bash
source .env
forge script --chain sepolia script/Deployer.s.sol:Deployer --rpc-url ${SEPOLIA_RPC_URL} --broadcast -vvvv
```
6. Copy the deployed contract address in the terminal and the CONTRACT_ADDRESS it in the src/constants.js of the root directory with it
